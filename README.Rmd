## phynotate

`phynotate` is a collection of `{shiny}` modules for interactive annotation of phylogeny plots. You can install it (to test) from GitHub using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("teofiln/phynotate")
```

### Motivation

`phynotate` is partly motivated by [`TinselR`](https://github.com/jennahamlin/tinselR) written primarily by [Jenna Hamlin](https://github.com/jennahamlin) from the CDC. Collaborating on some of the functionality of `TinselR`, it became clear that there is a lot more that we can do in terms of vizualizing and annotating phylogenies using `{shiny}`. So `phynotate` started as a general purpose package of modules that allows one to spin-up custom `{shiny}` apps that use `ggtree` and `ggplot2` to display and annotate trees.

### Usage

There are two main ways to use the modules, in an interactive `R` session or by 'embedding' in an existing `{shiny}` app.

#### Using `phynotate` in interactive `R` sessions

In many cases we either obtain a phylogeny (or other tree-like structure that can be converted to an object of class `phylo`) by running some analysis in `R`, or we load a phylogeny created by another program into `R` for further analyses or visualization. Although there is certainly no reason why we couldn't write `ape`, `phytools`, or `ggtree` code to create and save a custom plot of our tree, often, we just want to take a quick look, make some minor edits by clicking with a mouse and close the tree. This last part is a bit more difficult for a novice user of phylogeny plotting packages that is acustomed to an interface like `FigTree` or `Dendroscope`. `phynotate` attempts to fill this niche. To save a some time on making a decent figure through a GUI without writing the `phylo` object to file and leaving the `R` session.

An example workflow. We run some exciting analysis that results with 100 trees and we need to glimpse tree 54: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ape)

Trees <- replicate(n = 100, expr = rcoal(30), simplify = FALSE)
Trees[[54]]

# Phylogenetic tree with 30 tips and 29 internal nodes.
# 
# Tip labels:
#	 t9, t8, t14, t5, t23, t27, ...
#
# Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

Opening a `{shiny}` app within our browser with tree 54 is then as easy as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(phynotate)
make_phynotate(phylogeny = Trees[[54]], draw_modules = "LPTB", annotation_module = TRUE)
```

#### Embedding `phynotate` modules in larger `{shiny}` apps

`phynotate` is entirely made up of `{shiny}` modules and their helpers (mostly not exported) or wrappers (like `make_phynotate()`). If you have an existing shiny app, where you would like to display a phylogeny and allow some modifications to it, perhaps even downloads, then calling the `phynotate` modules might be a good option. 

For example (modified from the help of `phynotate::main_server()`):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(phynotate)

ui <- shiny::navbarPage(
  title = "A shiny app where we need to include a page for phylogeny viz",
  tabPanel(title = "Download sequences"),
  tabPanel(title = "Infer orthology"),
  tabPanel(
    title = "Vizualize and download trees",
    phynotate::main_ui(
      id = "id",
      draw_modules = "LPTB",
      anno_module = FALSE
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # Server code to download sequences
  # Server code to infer orthology
  
  # Send a user selected tree to the phynotate viz module
  main_server(id = "id",
              phylogeny = input[["user_selected_tree"]],
              draw_modules = "LPTB")
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

### TODO:

This is a work in progress and there are many features yet to be implemented:

2. tips missing for circular layouts
4. nodes 
5. ladderize
5. root
6. prune
6. name clade
7. color branches in clade
8. color tips in clade
9. map variable onto branch weight
10. map variable onto branch color
11. map variable onto tip symbol
12. map variable onto tip color
11. map variable onto node symbol
12. map variable onto node color
13. scale bar
14. axis
